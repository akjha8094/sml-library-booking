# 📊 Reports Fix & Gallery System Implementation

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Reports Not Showing Data
**Problem**: Reports were using `created_at` column for payments table, but it uses `payment_date`

**Fix**: Updated `reportRoutes.js` to use correct column names:
- Users table: `created_at`
- Bookings table: `created_at`  
- Payments table: `payment_date`

**Result**: ✅ Reports now showing correct data for all periods (today, week, month, year)
