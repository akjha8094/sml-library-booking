# üñºÔ∏è Gallery System - Setup Complete & Fixed

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Images not showing after upload
**Root Cause:** Gallery was returning relative paths (`/uploads/image.jpg`) instead of full URLs.

**Solution:** Updated [`galleryRoutes.js`](c:\xampp\htdocs\new\server\routes\galleryRoutes.js) to return full URLs:
- GET endpoint now returns: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/image.jpg`
- Upload endpoints return full URLs in response
- Images will now display correctly in gallery and preview

### Problem 2: Image URL not populating in Banner/Facility forms
**Root Cause:** Same as above - relative paths were being used.

**Solution:** 
- Gallery modal now receives full URLs from API
- Click to select automatically fills the image URL field
- Preview shows immediately after selection

### Problem 3: Missing uploads directory
**Root Cause:** Uploads folder didn't exist.

**Solution:** Created `c:\xampp\htdocs\new\uploads` directory.

### Problem 4: Gallery table might not exist
**Root Cause:** Database table may not have been created.

**Solution:** Executed `gallery_table.sql` to create the table.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

```bash
# Should exist: c:\xampp\htdocs\new\uploads
```

**Check 3: Gallery table exists**
```sql
-- Run in MySQL:
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'gallery';
```

**Check 4: Image path in database**
```sql
-- Should be relative path:
SELECT image_path FROM gallery LIMIT 1;
-- Result: /uploads/image-123456.jpg
```

**Check 5: Full URL returned by API**
```bash
# Test API:
http://localhost:5000/api/gallery
# Should return: "image_path": "http://localhost:5000/uploads/..."
```
