# 🎯 User Refund Request System - Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

I've implemented a **complete User Refund Request System** that allows users to request refunds for their bookings themselves, and admins can review and approve/reject these requests.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 👤 User Features:

1. **Request Refund from My Bookings**
   - "Request Refund" button on each eligible booking
   - Smart eligibility check (only active/completed bookings with payments)
   - Auto-calculated expected refund based on cancellation policy

2. **Refund Request Form**
   - Request types: Cancellation, Service Issue, Duplicate Payment, Other
   - Reason field (required)
   - Description field (optional)
   - Refund method selection (Wallet or Original Payment)
   - Real-time refund amount preview

3. **My Refund Requests Page** (`/my-refund-requests`)
   - View all submitted refund requests
   - Filter by status (pending, under_review, approved, rejected, completed)
   - Track request status in real-time
   - View admin response and notes
   - Cancel pending requests

4. **Cancellation Policy Auto-Calculation**
   - 7+ days before booking: 100% refund
   - 3-7 days before booking: 50% refund
   - Less than 3 days: 0% refund (no refund available)
   - Visual warning when refund percentage is less than 100%

## 🔄 Request Flow

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### User Side:

- ✅ Can't request refund if already fully refunded
- ✅ Can't have duplicate pending requests for same booking

### Admin Side:

## 📈 Business Logic

### Cancellation Policy:
```
Days Until Booking Start | Refund Percentage
-------------------------------------------------
7+ days                  | 100% (Full Refund)
3-7 days                 | 50% (Partial Refund)
< 3 days                 | 0% (No Refund)
```

### Request Types:
1. **Cancellation** - User wants to cancel booking
2. **Service Issue** - Problem with library service
3. **Duplicate Payment** - Charged multiple times
4. **Other** - Other reasons

### Request Statuses:
1. **Pending** - Just submitted, awaiting review
2. **Under Review** - Admin is investigating
3. **Approved** - Approved, refund processing
4. **Rejected** - Denied with reason
5. **Completed** - Refund processed successfully
