✅ CHANGES MADE:

1. ✅ Updated bookingRoutes.js to include:
   - payment_status (from payments table)
   - refund_status (from payments table)
   - payment_id

2. ✅ Updated MyBookings.js refund eligibility check:
   - Removed strict requirement for payment_status = 'completed'
   - Now checks if booking has final_amount > 0
   - Added debug logging to console

3. ✅ Backend server restarted

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧪 HOW TO TEST:

1. Open browser and press Ctrl + Shift + I (open DevTools)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/my-bookings
4. Look in the console - you'll see debug messages like:
   - "Checking refund eligibility for booking: X"
   - "Booking status: active"
   - "Payment status: completed"
   - "Is eligible for refund: true/false"

5. Look for the "Request Refund" button on active bookings

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❓ IF BUTTON STILL NOT SHOWING:

Check the console logs to see why:
- Booking status should be "active" or "completed"
- Final amount should be > 0
- Refund status should NOT be "full"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔄 NEXT STEPS:

1. Refresh your browser (Ctrl + F5)
2. Login as user
3. Go to "My Bookings"
4. You should now see:
   ✓ "Request Refund" button on active bookings
   ✓ Correct page title "My Bookings" 
   ✓ Refund warning messages

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 REFUND BUTTON SHOWS WHEN:

✅ Booking status = "active" OR "completed"
✅ Final amount > 0
✅ NOT already fully refunded

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you still don't see the button, share the console log output 
with me and I'll help debug further!
